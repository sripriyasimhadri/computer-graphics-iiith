      <b>Projections and Cameras</b></br> 
      <i>The Set-up: Bunny through a Camera</i> </br><a href="data2.html">Next</a></br>
      This experiment is designed to teach the orthographic and perspective projections using cameras and a bunny.
      The world represented as a tree is shown below. Each node is an instance. Each instance has 3 sections: Coodinate system, shape/instance, Transformation. Coordinate system is the local coordinate system of the instance. Shape/Instance is the geometry or a child instance of the cuurent instance. Multiple shapes and child instances can be added where the child instance is again a node. Transformation is the set of transformations applied to the shape or instance w.r.t the local coordinate system.</br>
      A Camera node is similar to an instance. It has a Coordinate system which is a local coordinate system coordinate system wrt the Global fixed coordinate system. The camera is always placed at the origin of this Coordinate system looking towards -ve Z-axis. The Transformation section is the same as the other nodes. Camera node doesnt have a Shape/Instance section and hence no children can be added. The rest of the parameters define the camera.</br>
      All the values being shown can be edited by clicking on them. Any changes to the tree are reflected on the display and vice-versa.</br>
